  In this exercise, we will create and use the cache simulator for studying the
factors that affects the performance of cache accesses. The cache simulator will read
an address trace file from gcc_ld_trace.txt or go_ld_trace.txt . The simulator will show us
a number of cache hit, a number of cache miss, miss rate, and access time. Please
form a group of 2 students and follow the instruction.
Instruction
1. Please create the cache simulator which can simulate scenarios
2. Please use one address trace and simulate result.
3. Please fill miss rate and plot graph for each table.
